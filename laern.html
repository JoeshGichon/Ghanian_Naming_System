            For this week's Independent Project, you will be required to build a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.
